# dynamic_model_for_lyme
This is my interpretation of the dynamic host-vector model in the 2012 paper "Deer, predators, and the emergence of Lyme disease" by Levi et al.

The model describes how host densities and several parameters impact infected nymph densities. All materials I've used to create my R script belongs to the respective author.
